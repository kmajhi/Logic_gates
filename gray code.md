# Gray Code

Gray code, also known as reflected binary code or unit distance code, is a binary numeral system that has a unique property: consecutive values differ by only one bit. It is commonly used in various applications such as error correction, digital communication, and rotary encoders. Understanding Gray code can be quite simple once you grasp its fundamental concept.

## How Gray Code Works

In standard binary representation, as you count up from 0 to 7, for example, you might observe the following progression:

```
Decimal:  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
Binary:   000 001 010 011 100 101 110 111
```

Notice how neighboring binary numbers can differ in multiple bits. Now, let's look at the Gray code representation for the same sequence:

```
Decimal:  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
Gray:     000 001 011 010 110 111 101 100
```

In Gray code, as you progress from one value to the next, only one bit changes at a time. This property is particularly useful in situations where minimizing errors during transitions is essential.

## How to Convert Binary to Gray Code

Converting a binary number to Gray code is relatively straightforward. Here's a simple algorithm:

1. Start with the leftmost (most significant) bit unchanged; this will be the leftmost bit of the Gray code.
2. Examine each bit of the binary number from left to right.
3. For each bit, XOR it with the previous bit in the binary number.
4. Write the result as the corresponding bit in the Gray code.

Let's illustrate this with an example. Convert the binary number `1101011` to Gray code:

```
Binary:   1  1  0  1  0  1  1
Gray:     1  0  1  1  1  0  0
```

## How to Convert Gray Code to Binary

Converting Gray code back to binary is also straightforward. Here's how to do it:

1. Start with the leftmost bit unchanged; this will be the leftmost bit of the binary number.
2. Examine each bit of the Gray code from left to right.
3. For each bit, XOR it with the previous bit in the Gray code.
4. Write the result as the corresponding bit in the binary number.

Let's use the Gray code `1011100` and convert it back to binary:

```
Gray:     1  0  1  1  1  0  0
Binary:   1  1  0  1  0  1  1
```

## Applications of Gray Code

1. **Rotary Encoders**: Gray code is often used in rotary encoders to precisely measure rotational position. Since only one bit changes at a time, it helps reduce errors caused by switch bounce or electrical noise.

2. **Error Detection and Correction**: Gray code can be used for error detection and correction in digital communication systems, ensuring reliable data transmission.

3. **Digital Circuit Design**: Gray code is used in digital circuit design to minimize glitches and simplify circuitry in applications such as counters and multiplexers.

4. **Maze Solving**: In robotics and maze-solving algorithms, Gray code can be used to represent and navigate through maze paths efficiently.

Understanding Gray code and its properties can be valuable in various fields, making it an important concept in the realm of digital systems and communication.
