# Logic Gates

Logic gates are fundamental building blocks of digital circuits. They perform logical operations on binary inputs (0 and 1) and produce binary outputs based on predefined truth tables. Logic gates are widely used in digital electronics for tasks like data processing, arithmetic operations, and decision-making.

## Common Logic Gates

### 1. AND Gate

**Pin Diagram:**
```
      _____
A ----|     |
B ----| AND |
      |_____|
Y = A AND B
```

**IC Representation:** 74LS08, 7408

**Truth Table:**
```
| A | B | Y |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |
```

The AND gate produces a high output (1) only when both inputs are high (1).

### 2. OR Gate

**Pin Diagram:**
```
      _____
A ----|     |
B ----|  OR |
      |_____|
Y = A OR B
```

**IC Representation:** 74LS32, 7432

**Truth Table:**
```
| A | B | Y |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |
```

The OR gate produces a high output (1) when at least one input is high (1).

### 3. NOT Gate

**Pin Diagram:**
```
      _____
A ----|     |
      | NOT |
Y =   |_____|
      A'
```

**IC Representation:** 74LS04, 7404

**Truth Table:**
```
| A | Y |
|---|---|
| 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 |
```

The NOT gate (inverter) produces the complement of the input.

### 4. XOR Gate

**Pin Diagram:**
```
      _____
A ----|     |
B ----| XOR |
      |_____|
Y = A XOR B
```

**IC Representation:** 74LS86, 7486

**Truth Table:**
```
| A | B | Y |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |
```

The XOR gate produces a high output (1) when the number of high inputs is odd.

### 5. NAND Gate

**Pin Diagram:**
```
      _____
A ----|     |
B ----| NAND|
      |_____|
Y = A NAND B
```

**IC Representation:** 74LS00, 7400

**Truth Table:**
```
| A | B | Y |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |
```

The NAND gate is the complement of the AND gate. It produces a low output (0) only when both inputs are high (1).

### 6. NOR Gate

**Pin Diagram:**
```
      _____
A ----|     |
B ----| NOR |
      |_____|
Y = A NOR B
```

**IC Representation:** 74LS02, 7402

**Truth Table:**
```
| A | B | Y |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |
```

The NOR gate is the complement of the OR gate. It produces a low output (0) when at least one input is high (1).

These are some of the most commonly used logic gates in digital circuits. By combining these basic building blocks, complex digital systems can be designed and implemented. Logic gates play a crucial role in the functioning of computers, calculators, and various electronic devices.

### XNOR Gate

**Pin Diagram:**
```
      _____
A ----|     |
B ----| XNOR|
      |_____|
Y = A XNOR B
```

**IC Representation:** 74LS266, 74266

**Truth Table:**
```
| A | B | Y |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |
```

The XNOR gate, also known as the equivalence gate, produces a high output (1) when both inputs are the same (either both 0 or both 1), making it useful for comparing two binary values for equality.
